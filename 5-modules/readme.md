# MODULES FOLDER

For smaller components, there is the modules/ folder. While layout/ is macro (defining the global wireframe), modules/ is more focused on widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in modules/ since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.

- _media.scss
- _carousel.scss
- _thumbnails.scss

*Note:* The modules/ folder might also be called components/, depending on what you prefer.
